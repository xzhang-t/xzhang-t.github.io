Hi, I am Xinyi. I am a Ph.D. student at [Prof. Angela Dai](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/dai-angela)â€™s [3D AI Lab](https://www.3dunderstanding.org/) at the [School of CIT](https://www.cit.tum.de/cit/startseite/), TU Munich.
My research focuses on 3D/4D representations and generative models. Previously, I received my Master's degree in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2024, supervised by [Prof. Shu-Tao Xia](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/xst_en/main.htm). Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Sichuan University.
